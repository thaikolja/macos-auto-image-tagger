# macOS Auto Image Tagger

**macOS Auto Image Tagger** is a small action for [Dropzone](https://aptonic.com/) that automatically adds tags to images via the API provided by [imagga](https://imagga.com/auth/signup). With tags describing the content of the image, macOS and other apps are able to find the requested file.
